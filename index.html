                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Welcome to my page. I am Ashutosh Mukherjee, an MSc. graduate from RWTH Aachen University. I have keen interests in the field of Dynamics and Control. This page is supposed
                            to be a collection of all the projects I have been a part of throughout my career. Official journal publications are also included.
                        </p> 
                            <p>
                            After my bachelors, I worked in a research project associated with DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation, India). The project was related to the dynamic modelling and control system design of a lower limb strength augmentation exoskeleton.</p> 
                            <p>I also have experience as a Teaching Assistant at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, where I was involved in a graduate level course (Modern Control of Dynamic systems) and an undergraduate level course (Mechatronic Systems Lab).</p>

                            <p>Apart from having some experience in the Academic world, I also have been able to obtain some industry experience via my employment at Rheinmetall AG as a working student where I was able to develop skills in the field of simulations pertaining
                                to Electrostatic Synchronous Machines. My Master's Thesis was also in Rheinmetall in the field of Guidance, Navigation and Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
                            </p>

                            <p>I am extremely fond of endurance sports, especially long distance running. I frequently take part in 5Ks, 10Ks and half marathons across Germany, and I aim to qualify and compete at the 
                                very coveted Berlin Marathon by 2025. 
                            </p>

                            <p> I am a big believer in a proper and sophisticated documentation of my projects, and thus I religiously maintain a Github repository which contains almost all of the work I have done over 
                                my career in the last few years, from personal projects to thesis reports, and even the source code for this website. I am also quite a fan of the open-source world, given that so many 
                                open-source models and programs have been a huge help in my projects and have ensured that I don't end up reinventing the wheel, thus I also strive to make open-source contributions via my Github, albeit till now I 
                                have not been too successful in doing that and I hope to change that soon.
                            </p>

                            <p>You can reach me on my email, my phone, my LinkedIn, or my Github. All links have been attached at the bottom of this page.
